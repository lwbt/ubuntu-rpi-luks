== General

=== Motivation

This project should:

* Provide images with an encrypted root volume
* Provide a way for consistent automation and customization on desktop and
  server

Future goals:

* Create images with GitHub Actions (see below)
** The script was written to be executed unattended and interactively
** Current blockers:
*** There is no ideal way to "just" create a desktop image which can be
    provided a Cloud-Init answer file for initial provisioning. The desktop
    image is configured to run `oem-config` from the older Ubiquity Ubuntu
    installer, and converting the server image takes over an hour.
*** The images have duplicates in 'ubuntu.sources' which extends the time of
    the entire process.
*** While the server image could be built with GitHub Actions, the any desktop image exceeds the storage space available on public hosted Runners.
*** I need to investigate or get feedback about the risks of sharing encrypted images with a known passphrase

Resources and inspiration:

* https://github.com/ViRb3/pi-encrypted-boot-ssh[] --
  Essentially I turned these instructions into a script.
  Some of the instructions did not directly apply to Ubuntu.
  I skipped the SSH remote unlock in favor of using FIDO2 keys.
  TPM with Secure Boot is not supported on Raspberry Pi at the moment.

=== Support

I don't offer any support for this free time project.

If you find something to work on, to improve and send me a pull request, I will gladly accept it. For most other things, I will have to see if I find time.

My goal is to provide a script or images for LTS releases when the get released.

I'm only interested releases from 24.04 onward and which are
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases[currently supported].

== Resources & Research

=== Screen casts and recordings

I created recordings with Asciinema, these have been edited to reduce file size
and length. I assume the nobody wants to look at the package manager and
compression tools slowly moving towards completion. I chose to keep some of the
interesting error messages, but I removed the messages about duplicates in
`ubuntu.sources`.

You can find the recordings here:

* link:assets/[]
* https://asciinema.org/a/lZmHTjSBZtkRUNshCrl2P3CUZ[2024-05-15_134103_desktop]
* https://asciinema.org/a/TOIGiiGLYN1OyCm5yOSAMfCyE[2024-05-15_141805_server]
* https://asciinema.org/a/XX0TK589crOk4Uhi09dakeT2s[2024-05-15_144201_server+desktop]

=== Why does the new image compress so poorly?

Because encrypted bytes don't compress very well.

What I tried:

* Investigate how much free space the images contain:
** Desktop: 2.3 GB free
** Server: 800 MB free
* Find a suitable compression algorithm and compression level:
+
[source,bash]
----
time zstd -15 --keep --threads=$(nproc) # Compresses to 73% and takes 2 minutes
time zstd -19 --keep --threads=$(nproc) # Compresses to 72% and takes 12 minutes
----

=== Can the image size be reduced any further?

The newly created desktop image is now almost as big as RHEL AMD64 (3GB -> 9GB -> 7GB).
This makes it impractical to build in GitHub hosted runners and to offer as download.

What I tried:

* `resize2fs -pM` had no effect

Current status:

* We already created a new filesystem on the partition after extending it.
  Find the right size and avoid making things more complex before implementing LVM again.

=== Where does `/boot/firmware/README` come from?

I have given up and instead include a copy here.
link:README_boot_firmware_server.md[]

The format is not entirely compliant Markdown, but I found that easier to read.

What I tried:

* `apt-file search README` in chroot with many variations
* Searching in packages:
** https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/rpiboot
** https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/u-boot-rpi
** https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/raspi-config
** https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/linux-firmware-raspi
*** https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware

=== What are the risks of sharing encrypted images with a known initial passphrase?

Questions:

* What are the risks of sharing images of encrypted file systems with a known initial passphrase?
* How does this impact security?
* What can be done to mitigate the risks?
* What are the weak points?

== Publish images through GitHub Actions?

=== Do I have enough space to create the images on a GitHub Actions runner?

Public and private runners offer 14 GB of SSD storage.
Is that the amount of available space or the entire disk?

For desktop images I would need to use a self hosted runner as the uncompressed
images are 8GB and above.

Documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories[About GitHub-hosted runners]

=== How to `sudo` in runners?

Examples indicate that `sudo` can be executed without a password or similar requirements.

=== Alternatives

// TODO: Link to this project.
* There was a project that used packer
** I took a first look at it and found that it simply uses chroot, like it is done here.
   I'm not sure which workflow is simpler.
   I will take another look at it when I have time to decide which features are
   essential and which workflow is the most robust and easy to maintain.
   Considering the current state of Open Source, a script might still be better
   than a binary from a company that wants to increase its share holder value.
// TODO: Links to similar projects?

== Guidance

=== Which desktop option to choose?

* `preinstalled-desktop` When you just want the typical installation with additional encryption.
* `preinstalled-server...+desktop` When you are looking for automation with Cloud-Init.

=== How can I avoid downloading all the packages again and again?

Use a local package cache like `apt-cacher-ng`.

=== Why do you use a script after first boot to configure dropbear?

I want to avoid publishing and sharing images with hard coded public keys.
Therefore my solution is to wait for Cloud-Init, where every user can put their
public keys and where Raspberry Pi Imager and other tools and examples can help
a user, to supply the public keys and then configure dropbear.

=== Activation of `zram-config`

while it seems to be not active any more on desktop and server images, I
included functionality to install and activate it in the script.

=== Connecting to dropbear to unlock LUKS

You use the root account and the IP address you configured. Ideally your local DNS is configured that it will always give the client the same IP address.

[source,bash]
----
$ ssh root@192.168.0.218
Please unlock disk pi-root-decrypted:
cryptsetup: pi-root-decrypted set up successfully
Connection to 192.168.0.218 closed.
----

If dropbear is not configured to execute `cryptroot-unlock` on login then it
might look like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ ssh root@192.168.0.218
To unlock root partition, and maybe others like swap, run `cryptroot-unlock`.


BusyBox v1.36.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.36.1-6ubuntu3) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

# cryptroot-unlock
Please unlock disk pi-root-decrypted:
cryptsetup: pi-root-decrypted set up successfully
# Connection to 192.168.0.218 closed by remote host.
Connection to 192.168.0.218 closed.
----

To avoid issues with strict SSH key checking I have this in my `${HOME}/.ssh/config`:

----
Host pi.luks
  User root
  Hostname 192.168.0.218
  # Use a different known_hosts file to avoid issues with strict host key
  # checking
  UserKnownHostsFile %d/.ssh/known_hosts_luks
----

=== How long does installation of the desktop take?

On a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB RAM and a SATA M.2 2TB WD SSD (no chroot):

----
time sudo apt -y install language-pack-en pemmican-desktop ubuntu-desktop ubuntu-desktop-raspi ubuntu-raspi-settings-desktop

Need to get 651 MB of archives.
After this operation, 2332 MB of additional disk space will be used.

real  69m42.821s
----

While I have no fine grained data about downloading and installing packages,
downloading the packages was fast, installing was not.

On T580 with NVME SSD:

----
real  52m31.206s
----

On P14s with NVME SSD.

----
real  51m12.024s
----

It looks like it is not getting faster on faster hardware.

== Known issues

=== Slow speeds on some storage devices

It might not be related to encryption or anything from this project in general.

Some storage devices may give poor performance and even lead to system lockups
on Raspberry Pi. The cause is that some controllers advertise UASP but don't
handle it properly. You can use `usb-storage.quirks` to use USB-BOT mode.

Resources:

* https://vielmetti.typepad.com/logbook/2021/11/usb-storagequirks-setting-on-raspberry-pi-to-avoid-uas-issues-and-system-lockup.html[]
** https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=245931[Tutorial]
** https://linux-sunxi.org/USB/UAS#UASP_capable_chipsets_in_disk_enclosures[]
* https://smitchell.github.io/how-to-bind-to-the-right-usb-storage-driver[]

=== OEM Configuration and APT is slow

There are some issues in APT which occur during OEM configuration and when
using APT in `chroot`.

* link:DOCS/assets/oem-config.log[]
* https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/2065618

=== When the desktop gets installed it does not show the boot splash?

I know that you can press ESC to show console output, but I prefer to keep it like this for now before diving deeper and fix every tiny detail. The plymouth packages themselves are properly installed.

I tried to fix it by adding `quiet splash` at the end of `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`, but that did not help.

=== The installation completed and then the system rebooted while I was using the desktop?

The desktop will reboot up to 2 times when using Cloud-Init. It's best to not
start working on the desktop right away when you see the login screen. The
process also takes care of growing the file system. Before this process is not
complete you will only have less than 1 GB of free space.

You can monitor Cloud-Init's progress with:

`tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log`

or

`ssh ${your_host} 'tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log`

On completion you will see the following entry:

----
Cloud-init v. 24.1.3-0ubuntu3 finished at Wed, 01 May 2024 17:08:04 +0000. Datasource DataSourceNone.  Up 2916.67 seconds
----

=== Desktop image is broken after removal of `oem-config`

While the code is still in the script, you should not activate and use these
sections. This was my first attempt before I took the other option and added
functionality to convert the server image into a desktop image.

Using the bigger desktop image and only making a few minor changes would have
saved a lot of time, but while `oem-config` is part of the image it won't be so
easy.

Also Cloud-Init user-data is currently ignored.

=== `oem-config` removes `cryptsetup-initramfs`

This should have been resolved by executing `apt-mark manual
cryptsetup-initramfs` by the script. If `oem-setup` still suggests to remove
this or any other packages, you must decline this action by unchecking the
checkbox and only then clicking next.

=== Using FIDO2 keys with Dracut does not work for decrypting LUKS

Installing Dracut to use FIDO2 keys removes the 'flash-kernel' package which is
responsible for updating the boot partition with `initrd.img` and kernel image.
I tried creating Dracut hooks, but I have had no success yet.
