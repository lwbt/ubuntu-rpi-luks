== Introduction

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the passphrase is the first thing you should do after the installation
has been completed.

See: link:#change-the-passphrase-on-the-pi[]

====

This script will create an Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi image with an encrypted root partition for you.

Supported images at the moment are: Ubuntu Server 24.04. While I wanted to have
a consistent way for both server and desktop, I found that the way how the
desktop image is configured with `oem-setup` does not work well with
Cloud-Init. My recommendation therefore is to use the server image and install
the desktop package.

[NOTE]

[%collapsible]
=====
* Use a trap if some command fails in the script to clean up everything.
* Installations of snap-based applications are skipped in chroot and should be
  installed through Cloud-Init
** Known applications: Firefox, Thunderbird
* Investigate how to reduce image size further:
  link:DOCS/FAQ.adoc#can-the-image-size-be-reduced-any-further[]
* Document compression choice and sizes:

== Using the script

Requirements:

* Packages: `apt install -y parted kpartx cryptsetup-bin rsync`
* Packages: `apt install -y binfmt-support qemu-user-static`
** These are required when you execute the script on a different architecture.
   Raspberry Pi uses `arm64`, PCs use `amd64`.
* Raspberry Pi Imager -- I recommend you get it from Flathub
  https://flathub.org/apps/org.raspberrypi.rpi-imager
* You need
  https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[gum]
  to run this script in interactive mode.

[TIP]

[%collapsible]
=====
** What is `gum`? It provides a simple way to create interactive scripts with
   forms.
** Just download the binary and put it somewhere on your `$PATH`.
** If you have not used pipx before do `apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
   and put the `gum` binary under `$HOME/.local/bin/`. pipx has nothing to do
   with any of this here, I just prefer `$HOME/.local/bin/` over `$HOME/bin/`
   and instructing users to modify some of their shell configuration files in a
   few different ways.

.Running the script:
[source,bash]
----
# Interactive mode
./run

# Unattended modes
./run rpi4
./run rpi5
----

== Writing the image with Raspberry Pi Imager

When the script has finished you can open Raspberry Pi Imager and select
*custom image*.

Once the image has been written by Raspberry Pi Imager, you can copy your
`user-data` to the boot partition (`system-boot`). The script is not intended
to include customized user data to images. That may be convenient, but is
considered out of scope and would introduce the issue of dealing with unknown
or "tainted" images.

I provided examples in the link:cloud-init/[] folder.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Review the example content carefully and only include what you need and what
you understand. I provided a few things to show what can be achieved when using
Cloud-Init on desktops.

== Change the passphrase on the Pi

.Change the LUKS passphrase after first boot:
[source,bash]
----
# Get and overview and find your root volume (/)
# The device you are looking for should be something like:
# sdX2, mmcblkXp2, nvme0nXp2
lsblk --paths

# Change the passphrase
sudo cryptsetup luksChangeKey ${YOUR_ROOT_DEVICE}
----

// TODO: Suggest to use FIDO2 keys

// TODO: Not ready yet.
// To achieve a higher level or security you can still create your own image with
// the script from your own computer. I offer these images for convenience and for
// situations where sudo access chroot and mounting images may be unavailable or
// impractical.
